## Advanced Features

### Image Ordering
Images are processed in the order selected. To reorder:
1. Clear current selection
2. Re-select images in desired order

### Caption Timing
Your JSON file should have this structure (must be an array):
```json
[
  {
    "text": "Hello",
    "startMs": 0,
    "endMs": 500,
    "timestampMs": 0,
    "confidence": 0.95
  },
  {
    "text": "World",
    "startMs": 500,
    "endMs": 1000,
    "timestampMs": 500,
    "confidence": 0.98
  }
]
```

**Important:**
- Times are in **milliseconds** (1000ms = 1 second)
- Must use `startMs` and `endMs` (not `start` and `end`)
- `timestampMs` is usually the same as `startMs`
- `confidence` is optional but recommended (0 to 1 scale)
- The file will be automatically saved as `Untitled.json`

### Multiple Videos
After saving one video:
1. UI automatically clears
2. Select new assets
3. Render again
4. No need to restart application

## Customization

### Editing config.py

You can customize the GUI by editing `config.py`:

```python
# Window size
WINDOW_WIDTH = 700
WINDOW_HEIGHT = 600

# Colors
COLOR_READY = "green"
COLOR_PROCESSING = "orange"
COLOR_ERROR = "red"

# Behavior
CONFIRM_BEFORE_RENDER = True
AUTO_CLEANUP_AFTER_SAVE = True
```

Save the file and restart the GUI to see changes.

### Video Effects

To customize video effects, edit these files:
- `src/Video.jsx` - Main video component
- `src/CaptionDisplay.jsx` - Caption styling

Requires knowledge of React and Remotion.

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Won't Start

**Symptom**: Double-clicking does nothing or error appears

**Solutions**:
1. Check Python is installed: `python --version`
2. Run test_setup.py to diagnose
3. Try running from command line to see errors

### "npm not found" Error

**Symptom**: Error message about npm during render

**Solutions**:
1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
2. Restart your computer
3. Verify: `npm --version`

### Rendering Fails

**Symptom**: Render starts but fails with error

**Solutions**:
1. Check Status Log for specific error
2. Verify npm dependencies: `npm install`
3. Check assets are valid files
4. Ensure enough disk space

### No Audio in Video

**Symptom**: Video renders but no sound

**Solutions**:
1. Check audio file plays in media player
2. Verify audio format is supported
3. Check audio file isn't corrupted

### Images Don't Display

**Symptom**: Video is black or images missing

**Solutions**:
1. Use JPG or PNG format
2. Verify images aren't corrupted
3. Check image file sizes (max 10MB recommended)

### Captions Don't Show

**Symptom**: Video renders but no captions appear

**Solutions**:
1. Verify JSON file is valid
2. Check timing values are correct
3. Caption file must be in assets/audio folder

### Slow Rendering

**Causes**:
- Large image files
- Many images
- Long audio duration
- Older computer

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce image sizes before import
2. Use fewer images
